 *  Work on fixing the problem(s) with backtracking by allowing the parser to
    work on multiple states at the same time, in parallel.
    -  When an ambiguity is found, the state is forked. For instance, when we
       push a state but allow backtracking (backtracking w/ state popping). Also
       allows multiple nonterminals to be worked on in parallel.
    -  When backtracking is needed because a longer state failed, we can dump
       the longer state and apply the shorter one.

 *  Add support for nodes/tokens having multiple names. This reduces tree size
    by adding more metadata to the nodes.

 *  Add support for rules of length 0, such that 'a ::= | expr | expr "," a' (?)
